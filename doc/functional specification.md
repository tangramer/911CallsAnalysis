# FUNCTIONAL  SPECIFICATIONS


## 1. Interactive map visualization of 911 calls
### Background
#### we are interested in the 911 calls distribution in Seattle. This includes different types of incidents such as fire, medic emergency, crime, â€¦We are going to create many options where the users can choose specific information they are interested in to show in the visualization and hide those unrelated data. We believe such interactive freedom can improve the versatility of the data which makes them useful to different people from different fields. Besides, the big database we have can provide the information over the past ten years.

### User Profile
#### Users of different backgrounds can selectively browse the data they are interested in. For example, users can choose to show only fire alarm 911 calls which might be more interesting to people in the firefighting department. Officials from hospitals might be more curious on the 911 medic response data for medic response to try to redistribute their forces according to the geographical patterns in seattle.    Users can track the changes by selecting time/date.

### Use Case
#### Users can select two main  data to show:
#### a. 911 calls distributions of different types on a Seattle map
#### b. Statistic data of blocks / communities

## 2. Linear regression of specific 911 call type and temperature
